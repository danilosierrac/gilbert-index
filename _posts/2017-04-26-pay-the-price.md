I don't know who said this, but the quote goes something like this:

> <q>*If you want a thing, go find out how much it is and then pay the price*.</q>

And this “thing” refers to anything. Meaning if you want a piano, go find out what its price is, and then pay it. Or meaning if you want to run a marathon, go find out how much it’ll “cost” (in time and energy and spirit) and if you really want to run a marathon after determining how much it’ll be, then pay the price and you will cross the finish line. Or meaning if you want Financial Freedom, pay the price for it (in time and energy and spirit and saving and investing).

Think of all the times you didn’t pay the price. What would your life have been like if you had done so? And now imagine something you want today. And going out into the world and figuring out what's required in order to make the purchase. What would it be like if you pay the price?

I think this idea of ‘*paying the price*’ is a useful construct in examining your desires because it allows you to arrive at the truth faster. The truth being whether you want something bad enough. Or whether you’re ready—mentally, emotionally, spiritually, physically—to take on a project. Or whether there’s fear or another blocker in your way.

If you want something, go find out how much <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143115766/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0143115766&linkCode=as2&tag=gilbertindex-20&linkId=f4e52e9c51365464be3c212b63f708d8">life energy</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=gilbertindex-20&l=am2&o=1&a=0143115766" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is needed to make the purchase. And if you’re prepared to do so, pay the price. And I bet you achieve what you want.
