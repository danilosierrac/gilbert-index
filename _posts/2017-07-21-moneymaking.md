From this list you might gather my main skills are sales and speaking Spanish and writing. And you'd be right. Most of my net worth is because of these skills (note that I've probably saved about 75% of all the above earnings). 

But I'm not hitching my wagon to these skills forever because I'm a long-term investor. And the best long-term investment is the investment in yourself. Which means continually updating your skills.

And it's in this spirit and the spirit of Alternative Moneymaking that I've recently added another fun skill to my skill stack: coding. Specifically HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, the command line, among other technologies. You can see projects I've built [here](https://github.com/gilbertginsberg). And as such the next time I update this list you might see Software Developer added to it. Beekeeper, Financial Coach, Crazy Runner, Mayor of <span lang="es">Bogotá</span> are contenders too. 

\* I took a year off of school after my sophomore year of college and Epidemiologist Assistant was the job I worked. Long story.
