In addition to the Gilbert Index column, I teach and write about financial literacy at Wealth Meta.

And I recently wrote about **The Time Value of Money**, which you can enjoy [here](https://goo.gl/hxFEj6).

[Wealth Meta](https://goo.gl/Ox6eAK) is based in Portland, Oregon. And is a rare company in the personal finance world
because they actually give you valueâ€”in the form of quality articles and financial calculators.
